# E-commerce-Back-End
13. Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) Challenge: E-commerce Back End
## Purpose
We Are Making E-Commerce-Back-End.
Internet retail, also known as e-commerce, is the largest sector of the electronics industry, having generated an estimated US$29 trillion in 2017 (Source: United Nations Conference on Trade and Development). E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes. Due to the prevalence of these platforms, developers should understand the fundamental architecture of e-commerce sites.

Your challenge is to build the back end for an e-commerce site. You’ll take a working Express.js API and configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## Built With

* MySQL
